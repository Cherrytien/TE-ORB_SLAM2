## SemanticORB-SLAM
 SemanticORB-SLAM is a work that investigate two different methods to improve the tracking of [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) in environments where it is difficult to extract ORB features. Methods are:
 * Incorporate high level semantic information from an object classification system such as [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to improve ORB matching and association in frame by frame tracking. 
 * Utilize RGB-D odometry tracking based on the photo-consistency formulation of the frame-to-frame tracking problem performed in <cite>Real-time visual odometry from dense RGB-D images</cite> and implemented in OpenCV's RGB-D odometry class.

 ## License
 In our work we use the repo of [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) and [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet).

ORB-SLAM2 is released under a [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/blob/master/License-gpl.txt). For any commercial or academic usage, please visit ORB-SLAM2 github repo to ensure feasibility.

## Installation
For darknet and ORB-SLAM2, please install them separately. Our work has been tested on __Ubuntu 16.04__.

### ORB-SLAM2
We encourage you to read its [README](./ORB_SLAM2/README.md) for installation details first. Make sure you have installed these prerequisites:
* C++11 or C++0x Compiler
* Pangolin
* OpenCV, version higher than 2.4.3
* Eigen3
